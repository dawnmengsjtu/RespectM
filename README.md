# RespectM - method for single-cell metabolomics
This repository supplements the manuscript (Meng et al, 2021) which presents RespectM, a method for in situ microbial single-cell metabolomics of culturing microbial cells that integrates LEM cell chip, microscopy, and MALDI-imaging mass spectrometry.  

For a detailed introduction into the method, presentation of the results of RespectM investigations of various cells, and discussion of its advantages and capabilities, please read our manuscript.

Here, we present the source code implementing the method.
